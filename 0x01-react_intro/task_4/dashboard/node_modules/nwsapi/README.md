NWSAPI is the development progress of [NWMATCHER](https://github.com/dperini/nwmatcher) aiming at [Selectors Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/) conformance. It has been completely reworked to be easily extended and maintained. It is a right-to-left selector parser and compiler written in pure Javascript with no external dependencies. It was initially thought as a cross browser library to improve event delegation and web page scraping in various frameworks but it has become a popular replacement of the native CSS selection and matching functionality in newer browsers and headless environments.

It uses [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to parse CSS selector strings and [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) to transforms these selector strings into Javascript function resolvers. This process is executed only once for each selector string allowing memoization of the function resolvers and achieving unmatched performances.
